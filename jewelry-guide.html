      <h2>1. Understand the Occasion</h2>
      <p>The type of event is the first thing you must consider before buying jewelry. Different occasions demand different kinds of pieces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weddings:</strong> Bridal sets with chokers, layered necklaces, and bangles in 22K gold, featuring detailed handwork.</li>
        <li><strong>Engagements:</strong> Lightweight, elegant pendants or bracelets are ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Festivals/Parties:</strong> Statement earrings or bold rings work best.</li>
        <li><strong>Gifting:</strong> Choose gold lockets, chains, or delicate bangles with sentimental appeal.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Match Your Jewelry with the Outfit</h2>
      <p>Your outfit significantly impacts your jewelry choice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Traditional dresses (Lehenga, Sharara, Gharara):</strong> Pair with classic yellow gold sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Western/formal gowns:</strong> Go for rose gold or white gold for a modern look.</li>
        <li><strong>Pastel/light outfits:</strong> Opt for delicate gold pieces in lighter tones.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy embroidery:</strong> Keep jewelry simple and shiny for contrast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Always try the jewelry with your dress if possible.</em></p>

      <h2>3. Understand Purity & Certification</h2>
      <p>Gold quality is often misunderstood. Know the basics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>24K:</strong> 99.9% pure, soft — not ideal for intricate designs.</li>
        <li><strong>22K:</strong> 91.6% pure, perfect for most traditional jewelry.</li>
        <li><strong>Hallmark:</strong> Verify that your piece has a certified hallmark stamp.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always purchase from a certified jeweler who offers an invoice and purity certificate.</p>

        <li><strong>Round face:</strong> Choose long earrings or layered necklaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Oval face:</strong> Can wear most styles, including jhumkas and chandbalis.</li>
        <li><strong>Square face:</strong> Opt for oval or round earring shapes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Skin tones:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warm tones:</strong> Look stunning in yellow or rose gold.</li>
